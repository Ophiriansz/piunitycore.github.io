        <h1>Decentralization: Blockchain and Its Impact</h1>
        <p>Blockchain operates on a network of computers, reducing the need for central authorities. It is a decentralized
            technology that underlies cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, providing secure and transparent transactions
            without the need for a central governing body.</p>

        <h2>Key Features of Blockchain Technology:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Decentralization: No single entity has control over the entire blockchain network.</li>
            <li>Transparency: All transactions are recorded on a public ledger, visible to anyone.</li>
            <li>Security: Cryptographic techniques ensure the integrity and security of transactions.</li>
            <li>Immutability: Once data is recorded, it cannot be easily altered or tampered with.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Benefits of Decentralization:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduced dependence on central authorities, making systems more resilient.</li>
            <li>Enhanced security and privacy for transactions and data.</li>
            <li>Lower transaction costs compared to traditional financial systems.</li>
            <li>Enablement of innovative applications like smart contracts and decentralized finance (DeFi).</li>
        </ul>
