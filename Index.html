        <h1>Decentralization, Blockchain, and Cryptography</h1>
        <p>Blockchain operates on a network of computers, reducing the need for central authorities. Transactions within
            the blockchain are secured using cryptographic techniques, ensuring the integrity and security of the
            network.</p>

        <h2>How Cryptography Secures Transactions:</h2>
        <p>Cryptographic techniques, such as hashing and digital signatures, play a vital role in securing blockchain
            transactions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hashing:</strong> Each block in the blockchain contains a cryptographic hash of the previous
                block's data. This creates a chain of blocks, ensuring the integrity of the entire transaction history.</li>
            <li><strong>Digital Signatures:</strong> Participants in a blockchain network use digital signatures to
                verify their identity and confirm the authenticity of transactions. These signatures provide
                cryptographic proof that a transaction was authorized by the rightful owner.</li>
            <li><strong>Public and Private Keys:</strong> Cryptographic key pairs consisting of public and private keys
                are used to facilitate secure transactions. The public key is shared openly, allowing others to verify
                the sender's identity, while the private key is kept secret and used for digital signatures.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Benefits of Cryptographic Security in Blockchain:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Immutability: Once a block is added to the blockchain, its cryptographic hash is unique and cannot be
                changed, ensuring data integrity.</li>
            <li>Confidentiality: Private keys ensure that only authorized users can access and control their
                transactions.</li>
            <li>Non-Repudiation: Digital signatures provide proof of the origin, identity, and consent of
                transactions, preventing denial of involvement by any party.</li>
        </ul>
